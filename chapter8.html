<p>
Grandma muttered in my head, <i>"Elena just won't quit."</i> I looked at Elena like she'd lost it. "Why would I break off my engagement to marry you?"
</p>

<p>
She faltered, then forced it out. "I admit that I lied. That was my fault. I know you only picked Piper to get back at me. You've always loved me. If you call it off now, I'll marry you right away."
</p>

<p>
If this had been before, I would have been over the moon to hear her finally agree to marry me. But after all the times she threw me into danger for Miles, whatever I felt for her was long gone. I gave her a cold look.
</p>

<p>
"Whether it was the amnesia act or begging me to let you be with Miles, everything you did was to push me away. And from what I've heard, your family's business has bounced back remarkably well over the past few days. You're not short on money or partners. So why force yourself to marry me?"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flickered. She couldn't explain why. All she knew was that losing me left her feeling hollow and uneasy. I let out a long sigh. "I don't care what you're thinking. I'm getting married in ten days. The past is over. Stop showing up in my life. Please leave."
</p>

<p>
Elena sat there with her eyes down. She stayed silent and stubbornly refused to leave. Just then, Piper's voice cut in from the doorway, sharp and mocking. "Well, well, well. What an unwelcome guest. Chatting up my fiance while your lover waits outside isn't a good look."
</p>

<p>
The air snapped tight with tension. Elena let out a cold laugh. "Don't get cocky! Rowan and I actually have history. Who do you think you are?"
</p>

<p>
Piper didn't take the bait. She calmly poured Elena a cup of tea. "So what if you have history with Rowan? I'm the one who matters to him now."
</p>

<p>
Elena snorted. "How can you be so sure you matter to him? I'm the one who—Ah!" 
</p>

<p>
The hot tea splashed across her dress. Piper gave her an apologetic look. "My hand slipped. Sorry. That wasn't on purpose."
</p>

<p>
The apology only poured gasoline on the fire. Elena shot to her feet and knocked over the teapot, spilling hot tea onto Piper's forearm. I saw red. I yanked Elena back and snapped, "Have you had enough?"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't me," she blurted. "She didn't close the lid right."
</p>

<p>
My chest tightened at the sight of Piper's burned forearm. I called for a first-aid kit and carefully treated the burn. I didn't even spare Elena a glance.
</p>

<p>
"Rowan," Elena tried again, "I'm hurt too. Look..."
</p>

<p>
I looked up, my face grim. "Get lost! Now!" 
</p>

<p>
Whatever she'd meant to say died on her lips. She flinched at my expression, bit her lip hard, and stormed out.
</p>

<p>
From then on, the wedding plans proceeded smoothly. When Piper and I chose rings, Grandma urged me to pick the biggest diamond in the case. When we went to pick out the tux and gown, Grandma kept marveling that I looked just like Grandpa in his prime. Whatever I was doing, Grandma was there in my head, and I'd grown used to her presence. It steadied me in a way I couldn't explain.
</p>

<p>
Ten days later, Piper and I exchanged wedding rings. I heard Grandma's soft, shaky sob in my head. <i>"Now that I've seen Rowan married, I can finally rest in peace."</i> I wanted to tell her not to cry, but then remembered that she couldn't hear me.
</p>

<p>
More guests approached me, offering their congratulations. Piper wanted to get up to greet them, but I caught her hand and gently held her back.
