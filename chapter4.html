<p>
My mind went blank as I watched Elena shield Miles and run.
</p>

<p>
Even if she felt nothing for me, I had loved her for years and treated her well. With life and death on the line, she still couldn't spare a hand for me?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the weight on my chest was gone. Piper kicked the man off me, grabbed my wrist, and yanked me through the chaos.
</p>

<p>
"Move!" she shouted.
</p>

<p>
The corridor was in chaos, but security rushed in and quickly subdued the patients with knives.
</p>

<p>
I stood there dazed, still catching up to what had happened.
</p>

<p>
Piper pressed a cup of warm water into my hand. Something unreadable flickered in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
I didn't notice it, and I didn't ask why she was there. I just murmured a thank-you.
</p>

<p>
Word of the attack reached Grandpa within the hour. He blew up and demanded that both the Reed and Ashcroft families answer for it.
</p>

<p>
The Ashcrofts put Miles on lockdown and sent gifts as an apology. The Reeds were livid and forced Elena to come over and apologize in person.
</p>

<p>
That night, Elena walked in and dropped a bag of supplements on the table, her expression sour. "Rowan, what happened today had nothing to do with Miles. I'm the one who didn't help you. Why make him suffer for it? Are you settling a score?"
</p>

<p>
I lifted my arm. Fresh bandages wrapped it thickly. "Do you see this, Elena?"
</p>

<p>
She faltered for a beat, then pushed back. "You're not dead, are you? Everyone knows you're the scion of the Becker family. All you have to do is shout, and people will line up to protect you."
</p>

<p>
"Miles only has me. You saw it. He nearly got hurt, too. Stop going after him. Talk to Edmund and get Miles' confinement lifted, or I'll call off our engagement."
</p>

<p>
She said it as if she were sure I would cave.
</p>

<p>
But I was past disappointment. I didn't even have the energy to argue. "Security, walk her out."
</p>

<p>
The guards then escorted her out of my house.
</p>

<p>
At the door, she spun and snapped, "Rowan, you'll regret this!"
</p>

<p>
She didn't show her face the next day.
</p>

<p>
Grandpa took my engagement seriously and hosted the grandest banquet the Becker family had ever held.
</p>

<p>
All four of the great families were in attendance. I walked in wearing a tux.
</p>

<p>
Elena stood at the center of the banquet hall. Miles was next to her, grinning like he'd won.
</p>

<p>
I was briefly taken aback. How was Miles here if he was supposed to be grounded?
</p>

<p>
Grandma gave a cold laugh. "Elena must have pressured the Ashcrofts until they caved. She bends over backward for Miles, but she never once did that for Rowan. What a heartless woman!"
</p>

<p>
Elena glanced my way and looked off like I wasn't there, while Miles flashed me a cocky smirk.
</p>

<p>
Whispers ran across the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Why is Elena so cold to Rowan? And why is she glued to Miles? I heard that Piper is into Rowan. Maybe this engagement banquet isn't as simple as it seems."
</p>

<p>
"No way! Elena has amnesia and only remembers Miles as her boyfriend, but Rowan loves her deeply. His fiancee has to be Elena."
</p>

<p>
Piper's cold gaze slid over the group. They flinched and drifted away.
</p>

<p>
Grandpa waved me to the stage and handed me the microphone. "Rowan, this is your engagement banquet. You should be the one to make the announcement."
</p>

<p>
"Alright." I took the microphone and felt a burning gaze on me.
</p>

<p>
Elena was staring straight at me. I gave her a mocking smile, and I saw her tense up.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for coming," I said, my voice carrying across the hall. "I'd like to formally introduce my fiancee..."
