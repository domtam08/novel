<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="author.html">Roaring River</a></p>

<p>
Piper bolted away like a ferret. Grandma sighed. <i>"If only she stayed that shy all the time, she'd be so much easier to love. Without that sharp tongue, she's actually quite likable."</i>
</p>

<p>
I nodded, then glanced up and locked eyes with Elena. She had clearly seen my exchange with Piper. Her face had gone pale, shock written all over it. Miles nudged her a few times, and she didn't even react. 
</p>

<p>
Grandma let out a mocking laugh. <i>"Elena sulks whether Rowan chooses her or not. People only learn to cherish what they've lost."</i> I didn't bother with Elena.
</p>

<p>
I exchanged a few pleasantries with guests offering congratulations. Then, I grabbed my jacket and headed for some air. Suddenly, someone yanked my arm. I turned to see Elena, her eyes burning with resentment. 
</p>

<p>
"Why Piper? When did you start seeing her behind my back?" 
</p>

<p>
I shook her off. "Watch your mouth! My personal life isn't any of your business. If I'm not engaged to Piper, who exactly did you think it would be?" 
</p>

<p>
Her lips parted. "But we dated. You loved me, right?" 
</p>

<p>
I stared at her and almost laughed. "Didn't you say that you had amnesia and only remember Miles? You asked me to make room for the two of you, remember?" 
</p>

<p>
Yeah, she was the one who had asked for it. But why did her heart feel so restless, as if she were about to lose something important? She faltered, then tried a new angle. 
</p>

<p>
"I know I still love you. Our history is real. Maybe if we got married and spent more time together, my memories would come back." 
</p>

<p>
Grandma snapped in my head, <i>"She's still lying to his face! Shameless!"</i> I was done with her act.
</p>

<p>
"Elena, does no one tell you how ridiculous you look feigning amnesia while trying to have it both ways?" 
</p>

<p>
She froze, her fingers tightening on my cuff. "How... How do you know?" 
</p>

<p>
I shook her off, disgusted. "You asked me to give you and Miles space, and you've got it. Now, stop harassing me." 
</p>

<p>
I'd already taken a few steps when she tried to follow, but Miles held her back. "Piper isn't a good woman! Half of the people in our circle can't stand her! You should think twice!" Elena shouted behind me through clenched teeth. 
</p>

<p>
"I can think for myself," I said without slowing down. "I chose her. That means she's worth it." 
</p>

<p>
Elena was stunned. "You'll regret it!" 
</p>

<p>
"Sorry. I won't." 
</p>

<p>
Grandma actually clapped. <i>"Attaboy! That's the swagger I like!"</i> 
</p>

<p>
I pushed through the doors and leaned on the terrace railing, letting the night breeze cool my face. Suddenly, Piper's soft voice sounded beside me. "I told you to wait inside. What are you doing out here?" 
</p>

<p>
I turned to her and asked, "Doesn't this place remind you of our university days?" 
</p>

<p>
The heiresses of the four great families and I had been classmates. When we had no lectures, we'd drift to a window and let the wind clear our heads. Most days, it was Elena and me together. When she didn't feel like coming, I went alone and sometimes ran into Piper. 
</p>

<p>
Back then, we were like oil and water. I hated her barbed comments and the way she treated Elena. We'd snap at each other on sight. Only when we stood by the window with the breeze would she go quiet and share a few moments of peace with me. 
</p>

<p>
Piper handed me a beer, then tipped back her own and took a long sip. I could tell something was weighing on her, but I didn't say anything. Awhile later, she finally spoke. 
</p>

<p>
"Enough with the act. When are you going to tell everyone the truth?"
