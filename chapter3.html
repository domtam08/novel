<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="author.html">Roaring River</a></p>

<p>
Miles looked at me, his expression full of wounded innocence. "Rowan, I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention. I’ll slap myself if that’s what it takes for you to forgive me."
</p>

<p>
He raised his hand as if to actually do it. Elena immediately caught his wrist, her face hardening as she turned to me. 
</p>

<p>
"Rowan, that’s enough! He already apologized. Do you really have to be this petty over a small accident? You’re a grown man; act like one."
</p>

<p>
I looked at the blood dripping from my arm onto the polished floor. A "small accident." If the roles were reversed and I had bumped into Miles, Elena would likely have demanded I leave the city.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't ask him to slap himself," I said quietly, the exhaustion finally weighing on my bones. "I didn't say anything at all."
</p>

<p>
"Your silence is a pressure!" Elena snapped. She helped Miles stand up, dusting off his clothes with a tenderness she had never shown me. "Let’s go, Miles. Some people just don't know how to be generous."
</p>

<p>
I watched them walk away. My grandmother’s voice echoed in my mind again, full of disdain for the pair of them. I knew she was right. I had spent years being a shield for Elena, only for her to use that shield to protect the man who went out of his way to hurt me.
</p>

<p>
The next day, I went to the hospital to get my arm properly dressed. The scrape was deeper than I thought, and the hospital air felt cold and sterile.
</p>

<p>
While waiting for my prescription, a commotion broke out at the end of the hall. Several patients from the psychiatric ward had somehow broken loose, and one was wielding a stolen surgical knife, swinging it wildly at passersby.
</p>

<p>
People screamed and scrambled. In the middle of the corridor, I saw two familiar figures: Elena and Miles.
</p>

<p>
The man with the knife lunged toward them. 
</p>

<p>
My heart stopped. Despite everything, my first instinct was to move toward her. "Elena! Get back!"
</p>

<p>
But she didn't hear me. Or if she did, she didn't care. 
</p>

<p>
As the attacker closed in, Elena didn't look for me. She didn't look for an exit. She grabbed Miles by the shoulders, pulled him behind her, and shielded his body with her own.
</p>

<p>
"Run, Miles! Go!" she screamed, her voice trembling with a desperation I had never heard when she spoke to me.
</p>

<p>
She was willing to die for him. 
</p>

<p>
At that moment, the man pivoted. He wasn't aiming for her anymore—he was charging toward me, the closest person left in his line of sight.
</p>

<p>
I tripped over a stray gurney, falling back. I looked up, and for a split second, my eyes met Elena’s. She saw the knife. She saw me on the ground, defenseless.
</p>

<p>
She didn't move. She didn't shout a warning. She simply turned her back, gripped Miles’ hand, and ran the other way.
