<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="author.html">Roaring River</a></p>

<p>
My grandpa, Edmund Becker, hesitated as he studied my face.
</p>

<p>
Then he asked, “Rowan, are you sure about this? Piper is the one you’ve clashed with the most. Once I announce the engagement, there will be no turning back.”
</p>

<p>
In archaeology circles, Grandpa was a legend. Years ago, he had publicly declared that whichever of the four great families married their daughter to me would receive the Becker family’s full support in excavation rights and museum projects.
</p>

<p>
Elena Reed’s mother, Grace Sterling, looked unsettled. She quickly tried to persuade me.
</p>

<p>
“Rowan, Elena has amnesia and doesn’t remember you. But you’ve always loved her. Why not wait a little longer? Perhaps once you’re married, her memories will return.”
</p>

<p>
Before I could respond, my grandma, Martha Keller, clicked her tongue sharply in my mind.
</p>

<p>
<i>Oh, please.</i> In the past life, that scumbag Miles smashed Rowan’s watch. Rowan didn’t say a single word, yet Elena still threw him out. He stood in the rain wearing nothing but his sleep shirt and nearly froze to death.
</p>

<p>
<i>Piper was the one who showed up with an umbrella and found him a room for the night. She may seem harsh, but her heart is soft.</i>
</p>

<p>
Her words struck me like a blow.
</p>

<p>
I never understood why Grandma spoke of past lives, but hearing her now made my chest tighten. I couldn’t shake the feeling that everything she said had truly happened.
</p>

<p>
Miles Ashcroft had always been Elena’s first love. I only started dating her after they broke up.
</p>

<p>
“Grandpa,” I said quietly, “I’ve made my decision. I choose Piper Alden.”
</p>

<p>
Grandpa slid the photographs back into their envelope and placed a firm hand on my shoulder. “Very well. I’ll respect your choice. In two days, I’ll announce your engagement to Piper.”
</p>

<p>
Grandma let out a breath of relief in my mind. <i>Good. Maybe this time, Rowan will finally have a happy marriage.</i>
</p>

<p>
While Grandpa remained with the other elders to discuss business, I changed out of my hospital gown and stepped outside for some air.
</p>

<p>
The moment I left the room, I froze.
</p>

<p>
Three elegant, well-dressed women were waiting in the corridor. They were all my childhood sweethearts—each once considered a candidate to become my future bride.
</p>

<p>
Elena was there.
</p>

<p>
Piper was not.
</p>

<p>
Sabrina Collins smiled brightly and stepped closer. “Rowan, I heard that Grandpa Edmund is choosing your fiancée from the four of us,” she said, curiosity shining in her eyes. “So, who did he choose?”
</p>

<p>
Wren Porter laughed lightly. “Is that even a question? Everyone knows Rowan has always been crazy about Elena. He treats her like she’s made of glass.”
</p>

<p>
Elena glanced at me indifferently.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t remember anything from the past three years. The only thing I remember clearly is that Miles is my boyfriend.
</p>

<p>
“I know that during those missing years, you and I must have been together. I don’t love you now, but if my father insists on the engagement, I’ll accept it.”
</p>

<p>
Grandma scoffed coldly in my mind.
</p>

<p>
<i>In the past life, she pretended to have amnesia so she could keep Miles while clinging to Rowan for the Becker family’s wealth. In the end, she drove Rowan into depression—and even to his death. What a vicious woman. She should stay as far away from him as possible.</i>
</p>

<p>
I looked at Elena’s distant, emotionless face.
</p>

<p>
If Grandma hadn’t spoken, I might have believed her.
</p>

<p>
I had loved Elena. Truly.
</p>

<p>
And for a time, I had been foolish enough to believe that she loved me too.
