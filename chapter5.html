<p>
"My fiancee is Piper Alden," I announced.
</p>

<p>
The room went dead quiet, as if the air itself had paused. Wren stared at me, stunned. "Rowan, did you misspeak? Isn't your fiancee supposed to be Elena? How could it be Piper instead?" 
</p>

<p>
Murmurs rolled through the crowd, most of them insisting that I had to have chosen Elena. 
</p>

<p>
"I didn't misspeak," I said. "I chose my fiancee myself, and it's Piper!" 
</p>

<p>
I stepped off the stage and handed Piper the heirloom amulet that symbolized our family. Her expression flickered, and she didn't take it right away. My stomach tightened. "You don't want it?"
</p>

<p>
Piper hesitated for a moment, then let a smile lift the corners of her mouth. "I do. It's an honor for me and for the Aldens." 
</p>

<p>
She slipped the amulet into her pocket and gave Grandpa a respectful bow. Only then did I let out a sigh of relief. Everyone present knew how to read a room. With the decision made, they forced themselves to smile and poured on the flattery.
</p>

<p>
"I've always said that Rowan and Piper are a perfect match!" 
</p>

<p>
Grandma muttered in my head, <i>"You were the loudest one calling Rowan a doormat five minutes ago. Keep mouthing off and see how long before it blows up in your face!"</i>
</p>

<p>
"Exactly! Just look at Piper's poise," another gushed. "You can tell that she's on a different level just by how she stands there!" 
</p>

<p>
Grandma snorted. <i>"Funny! Weren't you just calling her a stone-faced spinster nobody would touch? And now look at you, laying it on thick! I'm sick of your fake flattery!"</i>
</p>

<p>
Every time someone gave a buttered-up remark, Grandma's comebacks echoed in my head. I couldn't help but laugh. Piper's brows inched up. "What are you laughing at?" 
</p>

<p>
For some reason, a streak of mischief stirred within me. "I'm just happy I get to marry you." 
</p>

<p>
She choked when she heard that, and color crept over her ears. Grandma chuckled. <i>"I didn't think that would make her blush."</i>
</p>

<p>
I hadn't either. Piper was usually sharp-tongued and cool, especially with me. She had a talent for needling me right to the edge.
</p>

<p>
Years ago, one of Elena's friends snatched the watch Mom had given me. I couldn't find Elena anywhere, and I couldn't win a fight, so I stood there, sick with anger and on the verge of tears. Just then, Piper appeared out of nowhere.
</p>

<p>
She grabbed the girl by the collar, slammed her against the wall, and yanked the watch back. I felt grateful and was about to thank her, but she scoffed instead. "Useless! Elena's unreliable! Rely on yourself!" 
</p>

<p>
The words hit like a bucket of cold water, and I ended up running off in tears. That was Piper. Her words were always harsh, but she always showed up when I needed her. 
</p>

<p>
Back then, I secretly resented Piper. Later, when I told Grandma, she just laughed and said that some forms of love may sound harsh, but they come from genuine care. I hadn't understood it then, but I do now.
</p>

<p>
Piper had seen through Elena a long time ago and didn't know how to say it, so she picked at me to get my attention. I had always lost every skirmish with Piper. Seeing her blush made me itch to tease. 
</p>

<p>
I leaned in a little closer and asked, "Aren't you glad you're marrying me?" 
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am. It's my honor. But can you step back? You're standing way too close," she said with a straight face, though her ears betrayed her with a flush of red. 
</p>

<p>
I pinched her ear lightly. Piper jumped back like a startled cat, then quickly steadied her voice. "I'm going to the restroom. Wait here."
