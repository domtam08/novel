<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="author.html">Roaring River</a></p>

<p>
It was just like three years ago, when Elena had set off fireworks across the entire city for me.
</p>

<p>
She had looked at me with devotion and said softly, “Rowan, I want to marry you. I want you to be the happiest man on earth.”
</p>

<p>
I had been moved to my core. We dated for three years, and I never expected that she had truly forgotten Miles.
</p>

<p>
She couldn’t afford to offend me, so she played the part of a woman in love.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps now she was tired of pretending. That was why she feigned amnesia and openly declared that she loved Miles. She agreed to marry me only to secure the partnership.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, I wasn’t going to let her get what she wanted.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to argue with Elena, but the look on her face told me how certain she was that I’d chosen her. So I swallowed my words and decided to let her bask in it for two days.
</p>

<p>
I was genuinely curious to see how she would react when Grandpa announced the engagement.
</p>

<p>
When I kept quiet, Sabrina nudged my shoulder. “So, Rowan, did you choose Elena?”
</p>

<p>
“You’ll find out in two days,” I replied evenly.
</p>

<p>
With that, I turned and walked away.
</p>

<p>
Behind me, Wren clicked her tongue. “Elena, it has to be you. Back when you were really sick, Rowan went everywhere looking for a cure. He heard the old church on Mount Northbrough was miraculous, so he climbed the mountain and prayed all night for your recovery. He’s completely head over heels for you.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that so?” Elena let out a soft, coy laugh. “I didn’t realize he loved me that much.”
</p>

<p>
My heart ached, but I kept my eyes dry. Everyone in our circle knew I loved Elena. People joked that I was a doormat, but I didn’t care.
</p>

<p>
I had lost my parents when I was young. Grandpa and Grandma spent years on archaeological digs and were rarely home. I was the kind of kid anyone could push around.
</p>

<p>
Only Elena stood up for me.
</p>

<p>
I’d liked her since I was a boy. When she confessed to me, I was over the moon and swore I’d treat her better than anyone else ever could.
</p>

<p>
But every kindness she showed me came with strings attached.
</p>

<p>
She didn’t deserve my sincere love.
</p>

<p>
“Rowan, wait!”
</p>

<p>
I turned and saw Elena walking toward me in her high heels, chin lifted.
</p>

<p>
“I know you’ve chosen me,” she said. “I’ll marry you, but my heart belongs to Miles. I hope you’ll leave us alone and not interfere.”
</p>

<p>
I stared at her. “Didn’t you lose your memory? What makes you so sure I’d choose you?”
</p>

<p>
Elena frowned. “Everyone says you love me. Who else would you choose?”
</p>

<p>
I almost laughed.
</p>

<p>
So she knew exactly how I felt—and this was how she intended to treat my feelings.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t worry,” I said calmly. “I won’t chase you anymore. I’ll stay out of your way.”
</p>

<p>
Honestly, if Elena knew I had chosen Piper, she would probably be delighted.
</p>

<p>
My words stunned Elena for a moment.
</p>

<p>
I turned and headed for the main doors.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this, Elena moved as if to grab my sleeve.
</p>

<p>
Just then, an electric scooter suddenly shot toward me from nowhere.
</p>

<p>
The front wheel slammed into my shin.
</p>

<p>
I hit the ground hard, my palms scraping across the floor as a wave of pain crashed over me.
</p>

<p>
Miles went pale. He jumped off the scooter and rushed over, reaching to haul me up. “Rowan, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hit you. Please don’t be mad.”
</p>

<p>
Before I could respond, Grandma’s furious voice rang in my head.
</p>

<p>
<i>That punk did it on purpose! He pulled the same stunt in the past life too! He was always playing dumb or twisting things to frame Rowan, and Elena fell for it every time. Neither of them is any good!</i>
</p>

<p>
Seeing Miles flustered, Elena immediately softened. “It’s fine, Miles. It’s nothing. With me here, no one will blame you.”
</p>

<p>
She steadied him, then shot me a warning look. “He only bumped into you. You’re not going to make a big deal out of it, are you?”
</p>

<p>
Blood slicked my forearm. Gritting my teeth against the sting, I pushed myself to my feet.
</p>

<p>
Miles looked at me, his expression full of wounded innocence. “Rowan, I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention. I’ll slap myself if that’s what it takes for you to forgive me.”
